### Ecommerce Page Project
This Ecommerce Project was built using the frontend library Reactjs / Next.js. 
For the backend I used Sanity, mainly to store all the products that are avaiable for purchase.
Register & Login functionality was managed with help of Firebase.
Orders, Users, and Shopping carts are stored on Firebase.
